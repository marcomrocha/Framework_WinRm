*** Test Cases ***
Verify that is posible make ping to WinRM
     Given I Set data windows rm
     When I make ping to this remoto machine
     Then It should retrive true result${expect_result}



*** Keywords ***
I Set data windows rm
    log to console    ${HOSTNAME}
    ${WIN7} =    get_class_win_7
    ${wini} =    builtWinRM    ${WIN7}

I make ping to this remoto machine
    get ping to windows rm


It should retrive true result${expect_result}
    ${actual_result} =    verify results    ${String_expect}
    Should be equal   ${expect_result}    ${actual_result}
