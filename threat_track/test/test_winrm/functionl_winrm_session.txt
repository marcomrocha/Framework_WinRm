*** Test Cases ***
Verify that is possible get the Windows RM IP configuration
     Given I Set data windows rm
     When I send the comand IpConfig to this remoto machine
     Then It should retrive true result${String_expect_IpConfig}


Verify that is possible get the Windows RM Environment variables
     Given I Set data windows rm
     When I run the method get environment variable
     Then It should retrive true result${String_expect_environments}

Verify that is possible get the Windows RM Hostname Configuration
     Given I Set data windows rm
     When I run the method get Hostname Configuration
     Then It should retrive true result${String_expect_Hostname}


Verify that is possible set execution policy to UnRectricted
    Given I Set data windows rm
     When I run the method Set Execution Policy to UnRectricted
     Then It should retrive true result${String_expect_Set_ExcPolicy}


Verify that is possible set execution policy to Rectricted
    Given I Set data windows rm
     When I run the method Set Execution Policy to Rectricted
     Then It should retrive true result${String_expect_Set_ExcPolicy}
